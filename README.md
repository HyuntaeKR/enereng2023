## <span style="color:skyblue">About</span>

* This repository is for the mid-term report project of the 'Energy Engineering' course of Fall 2023 in Korea University.
* The full paper report can be viewed in the <code>Case_Study_of_Wind_Energy_Production_Prediction_using_ARIMA_Model_HyuntaePark.pdf</code> file.

## <span style="color:skyblue">Abstract</span>
<span style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-size:12pt">
Wind power is one of the most efficient and reliable renewable energy sources.
For the effective use of wind power, the prediction of wind energy generation is an important task due to its stochastic nature. 
In this article, one day ahead forecast of Estonian wind energy production is made based on ARIMA model with seasonality. 
Comparison with the actual production indicated high errors in the forecast. 
Explanations for the deviation and potential solutions are presented.
